Smell: Raw numbers appear in your code -> define vars

Smell: Fragments of repeated code appear. -> use functions

Smell: Code needs a comment to explain what it is for. -> explanatory names

Smell: An expression becomes long.

Smell: Loop variable is an integer from 1 to something. -> for row in data manipulate row

Smell: It feels like surely someone else must have done this at some point. -> libraries

Smell: A function needs to work corresponding indices of several arrays -> use dicts/keywords not data[i] but data['angle']

Smell: You need to change your code file to explore different research scenarios. -> fixtures files (DRY)

Smell: Two neighbouring loops have the same for statement -> merge repeated code

Break a large function into smaller units
	Smell: A function or subroutine no longer fits on a page in your editor.
	Smell: A line of code is indented more than three levels.
	Smell: A piece of code interacts with the surrounding code through just a few variables.


Smell: You find it hard to locate a piece of code.
Smell: You get a lot of version control conflicts.
